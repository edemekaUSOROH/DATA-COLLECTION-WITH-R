# WEB-SCRAPPING-WITH-R
PROJECT: Web scrape a Global Bike-Sharing Systems Wiki Page With R
WHAT IS WEBSCRAPPING?
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. This involves using software tools or scripts to collect information from web pages and convert it into a structured format, such as a spreadsheet or database. Web scraping can be used for various purposes, including market research, data analysis, and competitive intelligence

 Before getting my hands dirty on the actual data analysis tasks, i first needed to obtain some background and context information about well-known bike sharing systems worldwide, such as their location, launch date, rental bike size, and so on.

i got such information from this Wiki page:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bicycle-sharing_systems

In this lab, you need to use the rvest library to obtain the bike sharing systems table from the above web page, convert the table into a data frame, and write the data frame to a csv file for future data wrangling and analysis tasks.
