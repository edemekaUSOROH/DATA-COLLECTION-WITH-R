# WEB-SCRAPPING-WITH-R
PROJECT: Web scrape a Global Bike-Sharing Systems Wiki Page With R

\n Before getting my hands dirty on the actual data analysis tasks, i first needed to obtain some background and context information about well-known bike sharing systems worldwide, such as their location, launch date, rental bike size, and so on.

i got such information from this Wiki page:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bicycle-sharing_systems
