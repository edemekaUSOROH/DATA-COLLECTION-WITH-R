# WEB-SCRAPPING-WITH-R
PROJECT: Web scrape a Global Bike-Sharing Systems Wiki Page With R

 Before getting my hands dirty on the actual data analysis tasks, i first needed to obtain some background and context information about well-known bike sharing systems worldwide, such as their location, launch date, rental bike size, and so on.

i got such information from this Wiki page:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bicycle-sharing_systems

In this lab, you need to use the rvest library to obtain the bike sharing systems table from the above web page, convert the table into a data frame, and write the data frame to a csv file for future data wrangling and analysis tasks.
